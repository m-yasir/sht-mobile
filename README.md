# SHT (Simple Habit Tracker) - Mobile [WIP]

Finally starting a project I find myself needing often. After using a couple of others, I think I need something simpler and less distracting. 

In simple terms, an app I am building because I am tired of all the paid ones, that do more than what I need.

# Why React Native?

- I am a Full Stack Javascript Developer that uses React in his day job.
- Comfortable with Javascript tools, and... nuances.
- Have a (positive) professional experience working with React Native in the past.

# Planned Features


## Functional

- Ability to add multiple habits, just a title for now.
- Define start date for each habit.
- Reset habits, in case of relapse/broken streak.
- Update dates of habits.
- Display progress on each habit.

## Non-Functional

- Minimal friction (UX)
- Minimal latency
- Minimal distractions

# Future Features

## Functional

- Detailed datetime UI -> Shows days, hours, minutes, seconds etc.
- Some nice charts of progress and streaks.
- Note down triggers/distractions (on reset) and show them on next streak as a motivation.

**A couple notes:** 

- This is a list of features I might like but maybe just too busy/lazy to add at the moment. Might add them if there's a pressing need. 
- Please open a feature request issue if there's something you would like to see. 
- Please connect with me to create an issue on the feature and send a Pull Request in if you would like to add any feature.
